# DTSA5511_GAN_Monet
This repo stores the code and one set of images generated by a DCGAN for the Kaggle Monet GAN Competition. The zip file of images is too big (83 MB) to add here. I reduced it to a subsample of 70 images.

## Contents
1. Jupyter Notebook: Week5_GAN_v1.ipynb
2. Images: images.zip (70 generated images)

## Notes
I developed and ran the notebook in Google Colab as to access the GPU resources there.
